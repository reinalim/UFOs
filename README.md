# UFOs

## Project Overview
This project is to help our client to create a dynamic table that works on their website, which allows users to filter data by date, city, state, country, shape to search for accurate results as they desire. As per client's request, we are providing an in-depth analysis on UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Summary

### Drawback of Current Webpage:
- One major drawback of current webpage is that it requires users to manually delete values from each search box in order to remove all filters. 

### Recommendations for Future Development:
- Remove case-sensitive feature when users search for elements in the dataset.
- Add/allow search date by period (From and To) to simplify search options for users to provide enhanced user experience.
